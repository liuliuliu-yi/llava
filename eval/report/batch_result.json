Additionally, myocardial ischemia is present, which is a reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle due to narrowed or blocked coronary arteries. This can lead to chest pain or discomfort and may increase the risk of a heart attack. Further evaluation and treatment may be needed to manage these conditions.", "inference_time": 159.4636402130127}
