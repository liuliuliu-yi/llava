Sinus rhythm is a normal heart rhythm that originates from the sinoatrial (SA) node in the heart. This means that your heart is beating regularly and there are no signs of any abnormal heart rhythms or conduction disturbances.\n\nIt is important to note that an ECG is just one tool used to assess heart function and should be interpreted in the context of your overall health and medical history.
